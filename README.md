#  Student Dropout & Success Analysis

##  Overview
This project analyzes student data to understand the factors that contribute to **dropout** and **success**.  
It uses **Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau and Visualization** techniques to find patterns and insights that can help improve student retention.

---

## Dataset
- The dataset contains details about students such as target, gender, attendance timing, parent's qualification & occupation, demographics, grades, and other academic information.  
- Data was cleaned and preprocessed before analysis.

##  Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Looked for missing/duplicate values
   - Encoded categorical variables  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Trends in dropout vs success
   - Comparison by courses, grades, etc.  
3. **Visualization**
   - Matplotlib & Seaborn charts  
   - Example: Dropout rate per course, Outcome distribution by course, etc.  
4. **Feature Engineering & Model Training**
   - Created new features to improve model performance and evaluated model using accuracy, precision, recall, and feature importance.

##  Key Insights
- PassRatio and FinancialStress are the most important factors affecting student success.
- AgeAtEnrollment has little impact in comparison.
- Schools should support students with low academic performance and provide financial assistance to reduce dropout risk.
- Males drop out at a higher rate than females.
- Older students have higher dropout rates than younger ones.
- Married students tend to stay in school more than unmarried students.
- Scholarship holders are more likely to graduate.
- Parents education helps students succeed.
- Financial issues increase the chance of dropping out.
